# G(e)olang

## What's here

A couple of examples of using the Go [geo "standard" library](http://github.com/golang/geo).

1) *trendy.go* Using s2 cells rapidly identify what neighborhood a venue is in
2) *walkable.go* Using the standard library identify venues that are within a given radius of each other

## How to use

you can use the standard `go test` or [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) for more understandable output
